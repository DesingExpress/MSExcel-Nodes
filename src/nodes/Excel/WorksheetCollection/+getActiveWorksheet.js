    // In the Excel Office JavaScript API, context is an object that acts as the bridge between your JavaScript code and the Excel application.
    // It provides access to the Excel workbook and allows you to queue up commands to interact with the workbookâ€™s contents.
    // 1. Access the workbook:
    //    You can access the Excel workbook through context.workbook, which then lets you manipulate worksheets, ranges, tables, charts, etc.
    // 2. Batch command execution:
    //    Office.js uses a queued command model. You issue commands (like reading or writing to cells), and those commands are queued in the context until context.sync() is called.
    // 3. Synchronization with Excel
    //    context.sync() sends all queued commands to Excel for execution and updates your JavaScript objects with the latest values from Excel.
